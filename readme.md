This repository is my system forSemEval-2014  Task  8:Semantic  DependencyParsing (Oepen et al., 2014), as the second course project for the Empirical Methods for Natural Language Processing course in Peking University, spring 2020, directed by Professor Yansong Feng and Weiwei Sun.  My submission  is  an  ensemble  system  made  up  of  arc-factored classification models.  The system is implemented  in  nearly  pure  Python  without any packages about machine learning or natural language processing.   It reaches 78.32% precision and 0.6888 F1 score on the test set provided by Oepen et al. (2014),and the prediction results for the newly released test set(esl.output and cesl.output) has been uploaded with the report and system code.
